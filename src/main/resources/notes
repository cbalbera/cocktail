notes re: GetMakeableCocktails
- each Cocktail has to include at least one ALCOHOL or LIQUEUR. we only need to check combinations that include one of those two, so that will somewhat limit the looping
- we can sort each User's Pantry by the ingredients' enum values (ALCOHOL = 0, LIQUEUR = 1) so we can check only the necessary combinations
- one algo to generate all combinations: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-possible-combinations-of-r-elements-in-a-given-array-of-size-n/
- one library: https://guava.dev/releases/snapshot/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/Sets.html
- potential alternatives: https://www.baeldung.com/java-combinations-algorithm


re: user preferences
- have a user flavor/preference survey to kick off recommendations
- get user feedback into drinks and feed back into reco algorithm
